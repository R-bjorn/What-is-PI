# What is π (PI)
> Succinctly, pi— which is written as the Greek letter for p, or `π` is a _mathematical constant_ that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to **_3.14159_**. Regardless of the circle's size, this ratio will always equal pi.

## About 

* One of the thing that i think is interesting about **π** is that it is an `irrational number`, meaning that its decimal form neither ends __(i.e. 1/4 = 0.25)__ nor becomes repetitive __(i.e 1/3 = 0.9999999... )__
* According to `Petr Beckmann's : A History of Pi`, the Greek letter π was first used for this purpose by **William Jones** in 1706, probably as __an abbreviation of periphery__, and became standard mathematical notation roughly 30 years later.
