# What is π (PI)
> Succinctly, pi— which is written as the Greek letter for p, or `π` is a _mathematical constant_ that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to **_3.14159_**. Regardless of the circle's size, this ratio will always equal pi.

## About 

* One of the thing that i think is interesting about **π** is that it is an `irrational number`, meaning that its decimal form neither ends __(i.e. 1/4 = 0.25)__ nor becomes repetitive __(i.e 1/3 = 0.9999999... )__
* According to `Petr Beckmann's : A History of Pi`, the Greek letter π was first used for this purpose by **William Jones** in 1706, probably as __an abbreviation of periphery__, and became standard mathematical notation roughly 30 years later.

## Brief Explanation

**pi**, in mathematics, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The symbol π was devised by British mathematician **William Jones** in 1706 to represent the ratio and was later popularized by Swiss mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>. Because pi is irrational (not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers), its digits do not repeat, and an approximation such as 3.14 or 22/7 is often used for everyday calculations. To 39 decimal places, pi is **__3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197__**

**The Babylonians** (c. 2000 BCE) used 3.125 to approximate pi, a value they obtained by calculating the perimeter of a hexagon inscribed within a circle and assuming that the ratio of the hexagon’s perimeter to the circle’s circumference was 24/25. The Rhind papyrus (c. 1650 BCE) indicates that ancient Egyptians used a value of 256/81 or about 3.16045. Archimedes (c. 250 BCE) took a major step forward by devising a method to obtain pi to any desired accuracy, given enough patience. By inscribing and circumscribing regular polygons about a circle to obtain upper and lower bounds, he obtained 223/71 < π < 22/7, or an average value of about 3.1418. Archimedes also proved that the ratio of the area of a circle to the square of its radius is the same constant.
